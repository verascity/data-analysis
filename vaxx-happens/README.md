# Vaxx Happens!

Is the debate on vaccines shifting over time? Is either side giving or losing ground? Or are things truly static?

This project will collect tweets around the dates of major news items pertaining to vaccines (e.g. measles outbreaks, 'Anti-Vax' celebrity interviews, etc.) and analyze them using machine learning. The ultimate goal is to see whether, over time, the sentiments appear to be shifting significantly further in one direction or the other.
